1. Mac OS X Install

All third-party libraries for the Linux version of KeepNote are cross-platform and should also work for Mac OS X.

python (http://www.python.org)
gtk (http://www.gtk.org)
pygtk (http://www.pygtk.org)
All of these libraries are also available through MacPorts and HomeBrew on Mac OS X. Once installed, KeepNote can be run directly from its source directory.

For example, yo install dependencies with MacPorts use the following command:

sudo port install py27-gtk aspell aspell-dict-en sqlite3
You may need to add your own language's dictionary (aspell-dict-XX) for spell checking to work completely.

2. git clone https://github.com/mdrasmus/keepnote.git
