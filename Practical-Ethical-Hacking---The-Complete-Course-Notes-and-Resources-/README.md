# Practical-Ethical-Hacking---The-Complete-Course-Notes-and-Resources-


This repository contains Notes and Resources associated with my studies. I am using this to track my work for future employment. Not included are books, and hard copies of my notes and work from those books (E.g. "Linux Basics for Hackers"). The specified course in this repository is
"Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course".

Search by Module # .pdf for notes, and Resource Module # for Resources
associated with the module #. 

Modules #1-3 pdf notes do not contain much information as they are not to the "meat" of the course
yet.

This is the first repository of many that will document my education/journey
toward a successful career in Red Team security and help give back to the infosec community.
